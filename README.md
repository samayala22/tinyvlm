# TinyRANS

### Toy solver to experiment and learn high performance techniques
---

## Main features roadmap:

- [X] 2D Euler Solver
- [X] Validation with NACA0012 Vassberg-Jameson
- [X] Multithreaded computation
- [X] Gradient calculation WLSQ / Green-Gauss
- [X] Viscous fluxes
- [X] Validation with Blasius Flat-Plate
- [X] Non-dimensionalization of the variables
- [ ] Implicit Euler + SGS
- [ ] Turbulence model: Spalart-Allmaras
- [ ] Validation with Flat-Plate + NACA0012
- [ ] Extend to 3D
- [ ] Optimizations
- [ ] Remove STL
