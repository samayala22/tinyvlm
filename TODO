- Get rid of 3D vectors and use homogeneous coordinates everywhere (4d vector).
- Move some of the logic from theodorsen test case to its own class
- Rename many functions and harmonize the API
- Consider calling delta_gamma directly from lu_solve

// store kinematics in the backend ??
// store flow properties in the backend ??

Notes:

- Backend takes raw device pointers as arguments otherwise it needs to be templated to take Buffer objects.
