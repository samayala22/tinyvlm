- Move some of the logic from theodorsen test case to its own class
- Consider calling delta_gamma directly from lu_solve
- Get rid of exceptions
- All backend functions should return a tf::Task so that we can build a single taskflow graph
- Retire Mesh object as it is simply not generic enough, all geometry data is simulation specific
- Cleanup vlm_types to include the bare minimum headers
- Use vlm_types in vlm_memory
// store kinematics in the backend ??
// store flow properties in the backend ??
