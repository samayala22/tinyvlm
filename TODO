- Move some of the logic from theodorsen test case to its own class
- Consider calling delta_gamma directly from lu_solve
- Get rid of exceptions
- All backend functions should return a tf::Task so that we can build a single taskflow graph -> most probably cancelled for now
- Retire Mesh object as it is simply not generic enough, all geometry data is simulation specific
- Take care of the narrowing conversions and uint <-> int comparisons
- Share code between backends and move most of the multi-body scheduling logic to be backend agnostic (consider retuning a tf::Task from each backend)
- Kinematics are currently defined for each surface. It would be more practical to group the surfaces in a hierarchy (body -> lifting surface)
- Write a transient PVTU interface with tinyvtu
