- [ ] Get rid of 3D vectors and use homogeneous coordinates everywhere (4d vector).
- [ ] Move some of the logic from theodorsen test case to its own class
- [X] Create additional SolverData struct for vatistas parameter (ideally find another paramater too) -> removed and directly put it as member of backend base class
- [ ] Rename many functions and harmonize the API
- [ ] Decide what to do with SoA3D and evaluate the fusion of the 3 buffers into one 
- [ ] using a view for multidimensional indexing.
- [ ] Instead of view, use a function that returns a tuple of the panel's vertex indices that takes in arg i, j values for chordwise and spanwise location

// store mesh in the backend ??
// store kinematics in the backend ??
// store flow properties in the backend ??
