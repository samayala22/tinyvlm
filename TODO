- Move some of the logic from theodorsen test case to its own class
- Consider calling delta_gamma directly from lu_solve
- Get rid of exceptions
- All backend functions should return a tf::Task so that we can build a single taskflow graph -> most probably cancelled for now
- Retire Mesh object as it is simply not generic enough, all geometry data is simulation specific
- Take care of the narrowing conversions and uint <-> int comparisons
// store kinematics in the backend ??
// store flow properties in the backend ??
// Should Memory be a singleton class ?
